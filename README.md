# 👋 Manuel Cruz Rodríguez — Linguist turned Data Analyst

### 📊 Data Science | NLP | Humanities + AI | Python & Power BI

I'm a **Junior Data Scientist** with a background in **Linguistics**, **Digital Humanities**, and **Natural Language Processing**. After graduating in Hispanic Philology, I earned two master’s degrees (*Digital Humanities* and *Creative Writing*) and I'm currently finishing a third in **Data Science & AI** at [Evolve Academy](https://evolveacademy.es), graduating in June 2025. The program is fully compatible with professional work.

🧠 I design and build Python-based projects that turn **text into insight**, blending linguistic depth, narrative awareness, and technical rigor. My work focuses on NLP, data extraction, and exploratory analysis applied to literature, culture, and meaning. These projects aren’t just academic: they’re built for curious minds (mine included) seeking to uncover **what usually goes unnoticed** in language.

🚀 **Actively seeking opportunities** in Data Analysis and NLP where I can combine critical thinking, clear communication, and creativity to generate measurable impact, especially at the intersection of language, technology, and storytelling.
