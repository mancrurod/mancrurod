# 👋 Hi, I'm Manuel Cruz Rodríguez

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a strong background in **Linguistics**, **Digital Humanities**, and **Natural Language Processing**. After graduating in Hispanic Philology, I completed two master’s degrees (Digital Humanities and Creative Writing), and I'm currently pursuing a third in **Data Science & AI** at [Evolve Academy](https://evolveacademy.es).

🧠 I'm passionate about transforming **textual data into actionable insights** through Python projects focused on:
- NLP (text classification, sentiment analysis)
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization and storytelling

🚀 **Looking for opportunities** in Data Analysis where I can combine analytical thinking with communication and creativity.
