# 👋 Hi, I'm Manuel Cruz Rodríguez

I'm a **Junior Data Analyst** with a background in **Linguistics**, **Digital Humanities**, and **Natural Language Processing**. After graduating in Hispanic Philology, I completed two master’s degrees (in *Digital Humanities* and *Creative Writing*) and I'm currently pursuing a third in **Data Science & AI** at [Evolve Academy](https://evolveacademy.es).

🧠 I'm passionate about transforming **textual data into actionable insights**, building Python-based projects that merge linguistic depth with data-driven analysis.

🚀 **Open to opportunities** in Data Analysis and NLP, where I can combine analytical thinking with storytelling and creativity.
